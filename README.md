## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My project will focus on the concentration of fast food restaurants in the United States. This project will attempt to pu tinto perspective the relationship between obesity rates and the amount fast food restaurants in the US. This topic is of interest to me because I believe that a healthy lifestyle is important. I am interested to see the distribution of fast food restaurants in the US and which state and city contains the most fast food restaurants per capita.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I will be using for this project was acquried through Kaggle.com. This particular dataset is a sample that represents a larger dataset. The reason I chose this dataset was because it was significantly smaller than the original dataset, however it will still accurately represent the distribution of fast food restaurants across the United States.

## Team Members
